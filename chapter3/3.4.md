# Exercises: Scope
## These lines of code are from a REPL session. Is y in scope for z?
1.
Prelude> x = 5  
Prelude> y = 7  
Prelude> z = x * y
 > Yes, y is in scope for z.

2.
Prelude> f = 3
Prelude> g = 6 * f + h
> No, h is not in scope for g.

3. This code sample is from a source file. Is everything we
need to execute area in scope?
area d = pi * (r * r)
r = d / 2
> No, not everything is in scope.

4. This code is also from a source file. Now, are r and d in
scope for area?
area d = pi * (r * r)
where r = d / 2
> Yes, r and d are in scope for area.

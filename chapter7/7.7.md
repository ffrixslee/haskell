# Exercises: Guard duty

1. It is probably clear to you why you wouldn’t put an otherwise in your top-most guard, but try it with avgGrade anyway, and see what happens. It’ll be clearer if you rewrite it as an otherwise match: | otherwise = 'F'. What happens now if you pass 90 as an argument? 75? 60?    
> Every input will be evaluated to an 'F' result.   

2. What happens if you take avgGrade as it is written and reorder the guards? Does it still type check and work the same way? Try moving | y >= 0.7 = 'C' and passing it the argument 90, which should be an 'A'. Does it return 'A'?  
> No, it does not. It returns 'C'.  
> **Hence, the order and the range matters.**  

3. What does the following function return?  

```hs
pal xs  
| xs == reverse xs = True  
| otherwise = False  
```

a) xs written backwards when it’s True.  
b) True when xs is a palindrome.  
c) False when xs is a palindrome.  
d) False when xs is reversed.  
> b)  

4. What types of arguments can pal take?  
> [Char]  

5. What is the type of the function pal?  
> [Char] -> Bool  

6. What does the following function return?    
numbers x  
| x < 0 = -1  
| x == 0 = 0  
| x > 0 = 1  
a) The value of its argument plus or minus 1.  
b) The negation of its argument.  
c) An indication of whether its argument is a positive  
or negative number or 0.  
d) Binary machine language.  
> c)  

7. What types of arguments can **numbers** take?  
> Num  

8. What is the **type** of the function **numbers**?  
> (Num a, Ord a, Num b) => a -> b

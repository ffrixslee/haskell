1. Given the following declarations:  
k (x, y) = x  
k1 = k ((4-1), 10)  
k2 = k ("three", (1 + 2))  
k3 = k (3, True)  

a) What is the type of k?  
> k :: (a, b) -> a   

b) What is the type of k2? Is it the same type as k1 or k3?  
> k2 :: [Char]  
> It is not the same as k1 or k2.  

c) Of k1, k2, k3, which will return the number 3 as the
result?  
> k1 and k3.  

2. Fill in the definition of the following function:  
f :: (a, b, c)  
-> (d, e, f)  
-> ((a, d), (c, f))  
f = undefined  

**Remember that tuples have the same syntax for their type constructors and their data constructors.**  
> f = (a, _, c)(d, _, f) = ((a, d), (c, f))

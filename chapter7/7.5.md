# Exercises: Case Practice

We’re going to practice using case expressions by rewriting
functions. Some of these functions you’ve seen in previous
chapters (and some you’ll see later using different syntax, yet again!), but you’ll be writing new versions now. Please note, these are all written as they would be in source code files, and we recommend you write your answers in source files, and then load them into GHCi to check, rather than trying to do them directly in the REPL.  
First, rewrite **if-then-else** expressions into case expressions.  

1. The following should return x when x is greater than y:  
functionC x y = if (x > y) then x else y  
```hs 
module FunctionC where

    functionC x y = 
        case x > y of
            True -> x
            _ -> y
```

2. The following will add 2 to even numbers and otherwise simply return the input value:  
ifEvenAdd2 n = if even n then (n+2) else n 
```hs
module IfEvenAdd2 where
    ifEvenAdd2 n =
        case even n  of
            True -> (n+2)
            _ -> n
```

The next exercise doesn’t have all the cases covered. See
if you can fix it.  

3. The following compares a value, x, to 0 and returns an
indicator for whether x is a positive number or negative number. What if x is 0? You may need to play with the compare function a bit to find what to do: 
```hs
module IfxIs0 where
    nums x =
        case compare x 0 of
            LT -> -1
            GT -> 1
            _ ->  0
```

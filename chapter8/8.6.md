# Chapter exercises  

## Review of types  

1. What is the type of [[True, False], [True, True], [False, True]]?  
~~a) Bool~~  
~~b) mostly True~~  
~~c) [a]~~  
**d) [[Bool]]**  

2. Which of the following has the same type as [[True, False],
[True, True], [False, True]]?  
~~a) [(True, False), (True, True), (False, True)]~~  
**b) [[3 == 3], [6 > 5], [3 < 4]]**  
~~c) [3 == 3, 6 > 5, 3 < 4]~~  
~~d) ["Bool", "more Bool", "Booly Bool!"]~~    

3. For the function below, which of the following statements
are true?  
func :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]  
func x y = x ++ y  
~~a) x and y must be of the same type.~~  
~~b) x and y must both be lists.~~  
~~c) If x is a String, then y must be a String.~~  
**d) All of the above.**  

4. For the func code above, which is a valid application of
func to both of its arguments?  
~~a) func "Hello World"~~  
**b) func "Hello" "World"**  
~~c) func [1, 2, 3] "a, b, c"~~  
~~d) func ["Hello", "World"]~~  

## Reviewing currying  
Given the following definitions, tell us what value results from further applications:  

```hs
cattyConny :: String -> String -> String  
cattyConny x y = x ++ " mrow " ++ y  
```

> -- fill in the types  

```hs
flippy :: cattyConny
flippy = flip cattyConny

appedCatty :: cattyConny
appedCatty = cattyConny "woops"

frappe :: flippy
frappe = flippy "haha"  
```

1. What is the value of appedCatty "woohoo!"? Try to determine the answer for yourself, then test it in the REPL.  
> "woops mrow woohoo!"  

2. frappe "1"  
> "1 mrow haha"  

3. frappe (appedCatty "2")  
> "woops mrow 2 mrow haha"  

4. appedCatty (frappe "blue")  
> "woops mrow blue mrow haha"  

5. cattyConny ((frappe "pink")(cattyConny "green")(appedCatty "blue"))  
> "pink mrow haha mrow green mrow woops mrow blue"  

6. cattyConny (flippy "Pugs" "are") "awesome"
> "are mrow Pugs mrow awesome"

## Recursion  
1. Write out the steps for reducing `dividedBy 15 2` to its final answer according to the Haskell code.  

    ```hs
    dividedBy :: Integral a => a -> a -> (a, a)

    dividedBy num denom = go num denom 0
        where go n d count
                | n < d = (count, n)
                | otherwise = 
                    go (n - d) d (count + 1)
    ```  
    ```hs
    dividedBy 15 2 =
    go 15 2 0

        | 15 < 2 = ...
        -- false, skip this branch

        | otherwise = go (15 - 2) 2 (0 + 1)

        go  13 2 1
        go (13 - 2) 2 (1 + 1)
        go  11 2 2
        go (11 - 2) 2 ( 2 + 1)
        go  9 2 3
        go (9 - 2)  2 (3 + 1)
        go  7 2 4
        go (7 - 2) 2 (4 + 1)
        go  5 2 5
        go (5 - 2) 2 (5 + 1)
        go  3 2 6
        go (3 - 2) 2 (6 + 1)
        go  1 2 7

        | 1 < 2 = (7, 1)
        -- for divisions with remainders, the remainder
         takes the place of the numerator
    Answer: (7, 1)
    ```

2. Write a function that recursively sums all numbers from
`1 to n`, `n` being the argument. So if `n` is 5, you’d add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 to get 15.  
The type should be `(Eq a, Num a) => a -> a`.

```hs
sumofn :: (Eq a, Num a) => a -> a
sumofn 0 = 0
sumofn n = n + sumofn (n - 1)
```  

3. Write a function that multiplies two integral numbers using recursive summation.  
The type should be `(Integral a) => a -> a -> a`.  

```hs
mult1 :: (Integral a) => a -> a -> a
mult1 x y = go x y
  where go x y
          | y == 0 = 0
          | otherwise = x + (mult1 x(y-1))
```

## Fixing dividedBy
Our `dividedBy` function wasn’t quite ideal. For one thing, it is a partial function and doesn’t return a result (bottom) when given a divisor that is 0 or less.

Using the pre-existing div function, we can see how negative
numbers should be handled:
> Prelude> div 10 2  
5  
Prelude> div 10 (-2)  
-5  
Prelude> div (-10) (-2)  
5  
Prelude> div (-10) (2)  
-5  

The next issue is how to handle zero. Zero is undefined for division in math, so we ought to use a datatype that lets us say there is no sensible result when the user divides by zero. If you need inspiration, consider using the following datatype to handle this:

```hs
data DividedResult =
      Result Integer
    | DividedByZero
    deriving Show
dividedBy :: Integer -> Integer -> DividedResult
dividedBy num 0     = error "Division by zero"
-- Normally, I would write an error exception but since they gave the type constructor `DividedByZero` then:
dividedBy num 0     = DividedByZero

dividedBy num denom = go num denom 0
    where go n d count 
              | n < d     = Result (count)
              | otherwise = go (n - d) d (count + 1)


I noticed someone on the web using signum as follows:

dividedBy num denom = go (abs num) (abs denom) 0 ((signum num) * (signum denom))
    where go n d count sm 
              | n < d     = Result (sm * count)
              | otherwise = go (n - d) d (count + 1) sm
```
> Signum is used in this case for flexibility of type conversion.

## McCarthy 91 function
We’re going to describe a function in English, then in math
notation, then show you what your function should return for
some test inputs. Your task is to write the function in Haskell.  
The McCarthy 91 function yields `x - 10 when x > 100 and
91 otherwise`. The function is recursive:

```hs
𝑀𝐶(𝑛) =
⎧{
⎨{⎩
𝑛 − 10 if 𝑛 > 100
𝑀𝐶(𝑀𝐶(𝑛 + 11)) if 𝑛 ≤ 100
mc91 = undefined
```

You haven’t seen map yet, but all you need to know right
now is that it applies a function to each member of a list and returns the resulting list. We’ll explain it in more detail in the next chapter:


`Prelude> map mc91 [95..110]
[91,91,91,91,91,91,91,92,93,94,95,96,97,98,
99,100]`   

<ins>Numbers into words</ins>  

```hs
module WordNumber where
import Data.List (intersperse)
digitToWord :: Int -> String
digitToWord n = undefined
digits :: Int -> [Int]
digits n = undefined
wordNumber :: Int -> String
wordNumber n = undefined
```

Here, `undefined` is a placeholder to show you where you need to fill in the functions. The n to the right of the function names is the argument that will be an integer.  

Fill in the implementations of the functions above so that `wordNumber` returns the English word version of the `Int` value.  

You will first write a function that turns integers from 0–9 into their corresponding English words: “one,” “two,” and so
on.  

Then, you will write a function that takes the integer, separates the digits, and returns it as a list of integers.  

Finally, you will need to apply the first function to the list produced by the second function and turn it into a single string with interspersed hyphens.  

We’ve laid out multiple functions for you to consider as you
tackle the problem. You may not need all of them, depending on how you solve it—these are just suggestions.  

Play with them, and look up their documentation to understand them in greater detail.

You will probably find this difficult:

```hs
div :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
mod :: Integral a => a -> a -> a
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
concat :: [[a]] -> [a]
intersperse :: a -> [a] -> [a]
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]
(:[]) :: a -> [a]

```
Also consider:  
Prelude> div 135 10  
13  
Prelude> mod 135 10  
5  
Prelude> div 13 10  
1  
Prelude> mod 13 10  
3  

Here is what your REPL output should look like when it’s
working:  
Prelude> wordNumber 12324546  
"one-two-three-two-four-five-four-six"

```hs
mc91 n
  | n > 100   = n - 10
  | otherwise = (mc91 . mc91) (n + 11)
```

### My answer: 
```hs
module WordNumber where

import Data.List (intersperse)

digitToWord :: Int -> String
digitToWord n
  | n == 0 = "zero"
  | n == 1 = "one"
  | n == 2 = "two"
  | n == 3 = "three"
  | n == 4 = "four"
  | n == 5 = "five"
  | n == 6 = "six"
  | n == 7 = "seven"
  | n == 8 = "eight"
  | n == 9 = "nine"

digits :: Int -> [Int]
digits n = [n | n <- [0..9]]

--Alternatively: 
digits n = enumFromTo 0 9

wordNumber = concat $ intersperse "-" digitsWord
 where digitsWord  = map digitToWord $ digits 1

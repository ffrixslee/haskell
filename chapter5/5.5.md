# Exercises: Parametricity

All you can do with a parametrically polymorphic value is pass or not pass it to some other expression. Prove that to yourself with these small demonstrations.  

1. Given the type a -> a, which is the type for id, attempt to make a function that terminates successfully but that does something other than return the same value. This is impossible, but you should try it anyway.  

> IMPOSSIBLE !!

2. We can get a more comfortable appreciation of parametricity by looking at a -> a -> a. This hypothetical function a -> a -> a has only two implementations. Write both possible versions of a -> a -> a. After doing so, try to violate the constraints of parametrically polymorphic values we outlined above.

    ```hs
    f :: a -> a -> a
    f x y = x
    f x y = y
    ```

3. Implement a -> b -> b. How many implementations can it have? Does its behavior change when the types of a and b change?

    ```hs
    f :: a -> b -> b
    f x y = y
    ```
    > Only one implementation due to being limited to type 'b'.  
    > No, its behavior doesn't change.

# Exercises: Type arguments
Given a function and its type, tell us what type results from
applying some or all of the arguments.
You can check your work in the REPL like this (using the
first question as an example):

Prelude> u = undefined  
> Output: u :: a

Prelude> f :: a -> a -> a -> a; f = u  
> Output: f :: a -> a -> a -> a

Prelude> x :: Char; x = u  
> Output: x :: Char

Prelude> :t f x  
> Output: f x :: Char -> Char -> Char

### *Note: It turns out that you can check the types of things that arenâ€™t implemented yet, so long as you give GHCi an undefined to bind the signature to.*  


1. If the type of f is a -> a -> a -> a, and the type of x is Char, then the type of f x is:  
**a) Char -> Char -> Char**  
~~b) x -> x -> x -> x~~  
~~c) a -> a -> a~~  
~~d) a -> a -> a -> Char~~  

2. If the type of g is a -> b -> c -> b, then the type of g 0 'c' "woot" is:  
**a) String**  
~~b) Char -> String~~  
~~c) Int~~  
~~d) Char~~  

3. If the type of h is (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b, then the
type of h 1.0 2 is:  
~~a) Double~~  
**b) Integer**  
~~c) Integral b => b~~  
~~d) Num b => b~~  

### *Note that because the type variables a and b are different, the compiler must assume that the types could be different.*  

4. If the type of h is (Num a, Num b) => a -> b -> b, then the
type of h 1 (5.5 :: Double) is:  
~~a) Integer~~  
~~b) Fractional b => b~~  
**c) Double**  
~~d) Num b => b~~  

5. If the type of jackal is (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a, then
the type of jackal "keyboard" "has the word jackal in it" is:  
**a) [Char]**  
~~b) Eq b => b~~  
~~c) b -> [Char]~~  
~~d) b~~  
~~e) Eq b => b -> [Char]~~  

6. If the type of jackal is (Ord a, Eq b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of jackal "keyboard" is:  
~~a) b~~  
~~b) Eq b => b~~  
**c) [Char]**  
~~d) b -> [Char]~~  
~~e) Eq b => b -> [Char]~~  

7. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of kessel 1 2 is:  
**a) Integer**  
~~b) Int~~  
~~c) a~~  
~~d) (Num a, Ord a) => a~~  
~~e) Ord a => a~~  
~~f ) Num a => a~~  

8. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of kessel 1 (2 :: Integer) is:  
~~a) (Num a, Ord a) => a~~  
~~b) Int~~  
~~c) a~~  
~~d) Num a => a~~  
~~e) Ord a => a~~  
**f ) Integer**  

9. If the type of kessel is (Ord a, Num b) => a -> b -> a, then the type of kessel (1 :: Integer) 2 is:  
~~a) Num a => a~~  
~~b) Ord a => a~~  
**c) Integer**  
~~d) (Num a, Ord a) => a~~  
~~e) a~~

# Exercises: Apply yourself

Look at these pairs of functions. One function is unapplied, so the compiler will infer a maximally polymorphic type. The second function has been applied to a value, so the inferred type signature may have become concrete, or at least less polymorphic. Figure out how the type would change and why, make a note of what you think the new inferred type should be, and then check your work in GHCi.

1. Type signature of general function:
(++) :: [a] -> [a] -> [a]

How might that change when we apply it to the following
value?

myConcat x = x ++ " yo"
> myConcat :: [Char] -> [Char]

2. General function:
(*) :: Num a => a -> a -> a  
Applied to a value:  
myMult x = (x / 3) * 5
> myMult :: Fractional a => a -> a

3. take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]  
myTake x = take x "hey you" 
> myTake :: Int -> [Char] 

4. (>) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool  
myCom x = x > (length [1..10])  
> myCom :: Int -> Bool

5. (<) :: Ord a => a -> a -> Bool  
myAlph x = x < 'z'
> myAlph :: Char -> Bool

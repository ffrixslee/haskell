12.5 Chapter exercises
Determine the kinds
1. Given:
id :: a -> a
What is the kind of a?
2. r :: a -> f a
What are the kinds of a and f?
String processing
Because this is the kind of thing linguists ahem enjoy doing in
their spare time.
1. Write a recursive function named replaceThe that takes
a text/string, breaks it into words, and replaces each instance of "the" with "a". It should only replace exactly
the word "the". notThe is a suggested helper function for
accomplishing this:
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 721
notThe :: String -> Maybe String
notThe = undefined
Example GHCi session using the above functions:
Prelude> notThe "the"
Nothing
Prelude> notThe "blahtheblah"
Just "blahtheblah"
Prelude> notThe "woot"
Just "woot"
replaceThe :: String -> String
replaceThe = undefined
Prelude> replaceThe "the cow loves us"
"a cow loves us"
2. Write a recursive function that takes a text/string, breaks
it into words, and counts the number of instances of "the"
followed by a vowel-initial word:
countTheBeforeVowel :: String -> Integer
countTheBeforeVowel = undefined
Prelude> countTheBeforeVowel "the cow"
0
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 722
Prelude> countTheBeforeVowel "the evil cow"
1
3. Return the number of letters that are vowels in a word.
Hint: it’s helpful to break this into steps. Add any helper
functions necessary to achieve your objectives:
a) Test for vowel-hood.
b) Return the vowels of a string.
c) Count the number of elements returned.
countVowels :: String -> Integer
countVowels = undefined
Prelude> countVowels "the cow"
2
Prelude> countVowels "Mikolajczak"
4
Validate the word
Use the Maybe type to write a function that counts the number
of vowels in a string and the number of consonants. If the
number of vowels exceeds the number of consonants, the
function returns Nothing. In many human languages, vowels
rarely exceed the number of consonants, so when they do, it
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 723
may indicate the input isn’t a word (that is, a valid input to your
dataset):
newtype Word' =
Word' String
deriving (Eq, Show)
vowels = "aeiou"
mkWord :: String -> Maybe Word'
mkWord = undefined
It’s only natural
You’ll be presented with a datatype to represent the natural
numbers. The only values representable with the naturals
are whole numbers from zero to infinity. Your task will be to
implement functions to convert natural numbers to integers
and integers to naturals. The conversion from Nat to Integer
won’t return Maybe, because—as you know—Integer is a strict
superset of Nat. Any Nat can be represented by an Integer, but
the same is not true of any Integer. Negative numbers are not
valid natural numbers:
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 724
-- As natural as any
-- competitive bodybuilder
data Nat =
Zero
| Succ Nat
deriving (Eq, Show)
natToInteger :: Nat -> Integer
natToInteger = undefined
integerToNat :: Integer -> Maybe Nat
integerToNat = undefined
Prelude> natToInteger Zero
0
Prelude> natToInteger (Succ Zero)
1
Prelude> natToInteger (Succ (Succ Zero))
2
Prelude> integerToNat 0
Just Zero
Prelude> integerToNat 1
Just (Succ Zero)
Prelude> integerToNat 2
Just (Succ (Succ Zero))
Prelude> integerToNat (-1)
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 725
Nothing
Small library for Maybe
Write the following functions. This may take some time.
1. Simple Boolean checks for Maybe values:
isJust :: Maybe a -> Bool
isNothing :: Maybe a -> Bool
Prelude> isJust (Just 1)
True
Prelude> isJust Nothing
False
Prelude> isNothing (Just 1)
False
Prelude> isNothing Nothing
True
2. The following is the Maybe catamorphism. You can turn a
Maybe value into anything else with this:
mayybee :: b -> (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> b
Prelude> mayybee 0 (+1) Nothing
0
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 726
Prelude> mayybee 0 (+1) (Just 1)
2
3. In case you just want to provide a fallback value. Try
writing it in terms of the maybe catamorphism:
fromMaybe :: a -> Maybe a -> a
Prelude> fromMaybe 0 Nothing
0
Prelude> fromMaybe 0 (Just 1)
1
4. Converting between List and Maybe:
listToMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
maybeToList :: Maybe a -> [a]
Prelude> listToMaybe [1, 2, 3]
Just 1
Prelude> listToMaybe []
Nothing
Prelude> maybeToList (Just 1)
[1]
Prelude> maybeToList Nothing
[]
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 727
5. For when we want to drop the Nothing values from a list:
catMaybes :: [Maybe a] -> [a]
Prelude> catMaybes [Just 1, Nothing, Just 2]
[1, 2]
Prelude> let xs = take 3 $ repeat Nothing
Prelude> catMaybes xs
[]
6. You’ll see this called sequence later:
flipMaybe :: [Maybe a] -> Maybe [a]
Prelude> flipMaybe [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3]
Just [1, 2, 3]
Prelude> flipMaybe [Just 1, Nothing, Just 3]
Nothing
Small library for Either
Write each of the following functions. If more than one possible unique function exists for the type, use common sense to
determine what it should do.
1. Try to eventually arrive at a solution that uses foldr, even
if earlier versions don’t use foldr:
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 728
lefts' :: [Either a b] -> [a]
2. Same as the last one. Use foldr, eventually:
rights' :: [Either a b] -> [b]
3. partitionEithers' :: [Either a b]
-> ([a], [b])
4. eitherMaybe' :: (b -> c)
-> Either a b
-> Maybe c
5. This is a general catamorphism for Either values:
either' :: (a -> c)
-> (b -> c)
-> Either a b
-> c
6. Same as before, but use the either' function you just
wrote:
eitherMaybe'' :: (b -> c)
-> Either a b
-> Maybe c
Most of the functions you just saw are in the Prelude, Data.Maybe,
or Data.Either, but you should strive to write them yourself
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 729
without looking at existing implementations. You will deprive
yourself if you cheat.
Unfolds
While the idea of catamorphisms is still relatively fresh in our
minds, let’s turn our attention to their dual: anamorphisms. If
folds, or catamorphisms, let us break data structures down,
then unfolds let us build them up. There are, as with folds, a
few different ways to unfold a data structure. We can use them
to create finite and infinite data structures alike.
iterate is like a limited unfold that never ends:
Prelude> :t iterate
iterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
iterate never ends, so we must use take to get a finite list:
Prelude> take 10 $ iterate (+1) 0
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
unfoldr is more general than iterate:
Prelude> :t unfoldr
unfoldr :: (b -> Maybe (a, b)) -> b -> [a]
Here’s how to use unfoldr to do what iterate does:
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 730
Prelude> f b = Just (b, b + 1)
Prelude> take 10 $ unfoldr f 0
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Why bother?
We bother with this for the same reason we abstract direct
recursion into folds, such as with sum, product, and concat:
import Data.List
mehSum :: Num a => [a] -> a
mehSum xs = go 0 xs
where go :: Num a => a -> [a] -> a
go n [] = n
go n (x:xs) = (go (n + x) xs)
niceSum :: Num a => [a] -> a
niceSum = foldl' (+) 0
mehProduct :: Num a => [a] -> a
mehProduct xs = go 1 xs
where go :: Num a => a -> [a] -> a
go n [] = n
go n (x:xs) = (go (n * x) xs)
niceProduct :: Num a => [a] -> a
niceProduct = foldl' (*) 1
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 731
Remember the redundant structure when we looked at
folds?
mehConcat :: [[a]] -> [a]
mehConcat xs = go [] xs
where go :: [a] -> [[a]] -> [a]
go xs' [] = xs'
go xs' (x:xs) = (go (xs' ++ x) xs)
niceConcat :: [[a]] -> [a]
niceConcat = foldr (++) []
This may give you a mild headache, but you may also see
that this same principle of abstracting out common patterns
and giving them names applies as well to unfolds as it does to
folds.
Write your own iterate and unfoldr
1. Write the function myIterate using direct recursion. Compare the behavior with the built-in iterate to gauge correctness. Do not look at the source or any examples of
iterate, so that you are forced to do this yourself:
myIterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
myIterate = undefined
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 732
2. Write the function myUnfoldr using direct recursion. Compare with the built-in unfoldr to check your implementation. Again, don’t look at implementations of unfoldr, so
that you figure it out yourself:
myUnfoldr :: (b -> Maybe (a, b))
-> b
-> [a]
myUnfoldr = undefined
3. Rewrite myIterate into betterIterate using myUnfoldr. A
hint—we use unfoldr to produce the same results as iterate
above. Do this with different functions, and see if you can
abstract the structure out.
It helps to have the types in front of you:
myUnfoldr :: (b -> Maybe (a, b))
-> b
-> [a]
betterIterate :: (a -> a) -> a -> [a]
betterIterate f x = myUnfoldr ...?
Remember, your betterIterate should have the same results as iterate:
Prelude> take 10 $ iterate (+1) 0
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 733
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Prelude> take 10 $ betterIterate (+1) 0
[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
Finally something other than a list!
Given the BinaryTree from the last chapter, complete the following exercises. Here’s that datatype again:
data BinaryTree a =
Leaf
| Node (BinaryTree a) a (BinaryTree a)
deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)
1. Write unfold for BinaryTree:
unfold :: (a -> Maybe (a,b,a))
-> a
-> BinaryTree b
unfold = undefined
2. Make a tree builder.
Using the unfold function you made for BinaryTree, write
the following function:
treeBuild :: Integer -> BinaryTree Integer
treeBuild n = undefined
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 734
You should be producing results that look like the following:
Prelude> treeBuild 0
Leaf
Prelude> treeBuild 1
Node Leaf 0 Leaf
Prelude> treeBuild 2
Node (Node Leaf 1 Leaf)
0
(Node Leaf 1 Leaf)
Prelude> treeBuild 3
Node (Node (Node Leaf 2 Leaf)
1
(Node Leaf 2 Leaf))
0
(Node (Node Leaf 2 Leaf)
1
(Node Leaf 2 Leaf))
Or in a slightly different representation:
0
0
/ \
1 1
CHAPTER 12. SIGNALING ADVERSITY 735
0
/ \
1 1
/\ /\
2 2 2 2
Good work.

## Traversable instances

Write a Traversable instance for the datatype provided, filling in any required superclasses. Use `QuickCheck` to validate your instances.  

### Identity
Write a Traversable instance for `Identity`:

```hs
newtype Identity a = Identity a
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

instance Traversable Identity where
    traverse = undefined
```

### Constant

```hs
newtype Constant a b =
    Constant { getConstant :: a }
```

### Maybe

```hs
data Optional a =
    Nada
  | Yep a
```

### List

```hs
data List a =
    Nil
  | Cons a (List a)
```

### Three

```hs
data Three a b c =
    Three a b c
```

### Pair

```hs
data Pair a b =
    Pair a b
```

### Big
When you have more than one value of type b, use Monoid and Applicative for the Foldable and Traversable instances, respectively:  

```hs
data Big a b =
    Big a b b
```

### Bigger
Same as for Big:

```hs
data Bigger a b =
    Bigger a b b b
```

### S
This may be difficult. To make it easier, weâ€™ll give you the constraints and QuickCheck instances:  

```hs
{-# LANGUAGE FlexibleContexts #-}
module SkiFree where

import Test.QuickCheck
import Test.QuickCheck.Checkers

data S n a = S (n a) a deriving (Eq, Show)

instance ( Functor n
         , Arbitrary (n a)
         , Arbitrary a )
        => Arbitrary (S n a) where
    arbitrary =
        S <$> arbitrary <*> arbitrary

instance ( Applicative n
         , Testable (n Property)
         , Eq a
         , Eq (n a)
         , EqProp a)
        => EqProp (S n a) where
    (=-=) = eq

instance Traversable n
      => Traversable (S n) where
    traverse = undefined

main =
    sample' (arbitrary :: Gen (S [] Int))
```

## Instances for Tree
This might be hard. Write the following instances for Tree:  

```hs
data Tree a =
    Empty
  | Leaf a
  | Node (Tree a) a (Tree a)
  deriving (Eq, Show)

instance Functor Tree where
    fmap = undefined

-- foldMap is a bit easier
-- and looks more natural,
-- but you can do foldr, too,
-- for extra credit.

instance Foldable Tree where
    foldMap = undefined

instance Traversable Tree where
    traverse = undefined
    
    Hints:

    1. For foldMap, think Functor but with some Monoid thrown in.

    2. For traverse, think Functor but with some Functor3 thrown in.

# Exercises: Comprehend thy lists
Take a look at the following functions, determine what you
think the output lists will be, and then run them in your REPL to verify (note that you will need the mySqr list from above in scope to do this):  
 
```hs
mySqr = [x^2 | x <- [1..10]]
[x | x <- mySqr, rem x 2 == 0]  
```
> Prelude> [x | x <- mySqr, rem x 2 == 0]
[4,16,36,64,100]

Exercises: Square cube
Given the following:
Prelude> mySqr = [x^2 | x <- [1..5]]
Prelude> myCube = [y^3 | y <- [1..5]]
1. First write an expression that will make tuples of the
outputs of mySqr and myCube.
2. Now, alter that expression so that it only uses the x and y
values that are less than 50.
3. Apply another function to that list comprehension to
determine how many tuples inhabit your output list.

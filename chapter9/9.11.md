# Zipping exercises
1. Write your own version of zip, and ensure it behaves the same as the original:

```hs  
zipList :: [a] -> [b] -> [(a, b)]  
zipList _ [] = []
zipList (x:xs) (y:ys) = (x,y) : zipList xs ys
```
> Taking two arguments lists x and y, pattern-matching the head followed by the rest of the list.

2. Do what you did for zip but now for zipWith:  
    zipWith :: (a -> b -> c)  
            -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]  
    zipWith = undefined  

    ```hs
    zipWithMe :: (a -> b -> c)  
            -> [a] -> [b] -> [c]  
    zipWithMe _ _ [] = []
    zipWithMe f (b:bs) (c:cs) = f b c : zipWithMe f bs cs
    ```

3. Rewrite your zip in terms of the zipWith you wrote

    zipList'  = zipWithMe (,)
    > The use of (,) converts it into the list of tuples.

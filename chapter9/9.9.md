# Exercises: More bottoms
As always, we encourage you to try figuring out the answers
before you enter them into your REPL:
1. Will the following expression return a value or be âŠ¥?
take 1 $ map (+1) [undefined, 2, 3]
2. Will the following expression return a value?
take 1 $ map (+1) [1, undefined, 3]
3. Will the following expression return a value?
take 2 $ map (+1) [1, undefined, 3]
4. What does the following mystery function do? What is its
type? Describe it (to yourself or a loved one) in standard
English and then test it out in the REPL to make sure you
are correct:
CHAPTER 9. THIS THING AND SOME MORE STUFF 505
itIsMystery xs =
map (\x -> elem x "aeiou") xs
5. What will be the result of the following functions:
a) map (^2) [1..10]
b) map minimum [[1..10], [10..20], [20..30]]
-- n.b. minimum is not the same function
-- as the min function that we used before
c) map sum [[1..5], [1..5], [1..5]]
6. Back in Chapter 7, you wrote a function called foldBool.
That function exists in a module known as Data.Bool and
is called bool. Write a function that does the same (or
similar, if you wish) as the map if-then-else function you
saw above but uses bool instead of the if-then-else syntax.
Your first step should be bringing the bool function into
scope by typing import Data.Bool at your REPL promp

# Exercises: More bottoms  

As always, we encourage you to try figuring out the answers
before you enter them into your REPL:
1. Will the following expression return a value or be ⊥?  
take 1 $ map (+1) [undefined, 2, 3]
> ⊥

2. Will the following expression return a value?  
take 1 $ map (+1) [1, undefined, 3]  
> Yes, value: 2.

3. Will the following expression return a value?  
take 2 $ map (+1) [1, undefined, 3]  
> ⊥  

4. What does the following mystery function do? What is its
type? Describe it (to yourself or a loved one) in standard
English and then test it out in the REPL to make sure you
are correct:  

```hs
itIsMystery xs =
    map (\x -> elem x "aeiou") xs
```
> It checks whether there are vowels in a String.  

5. What will be the result of the following functions:  

    a) map (^2) [1..10]  
    > [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100]

    b) map minimum [[1..10], [10..20], [20..30]]  
    -- n.b. minimum is not the same function  
    -- as the min function that we used before  
    > [1,10,20]

    c) map sum [[1..5], [1..5], [1..5]]  
    > [15,15,15]  

6. Back in Chapter 7, you wrote a function called `foldBool`.  
That function exists in a module known as `Data.Bool` and
is called `bool`.   
Write a function that does the same (or similar, if you wish) as the `map if-then-else` function you saw above but uses `bool` instead of the `if-then-else` syntax.
Your first step should be bringing the `bool` function into
scope by typing `import Data.Bool` at your REPL prompt.

```hs
import Data.Bool
foldBool = map (\x -> bool x (-3) (x==3)) [1..10]
```

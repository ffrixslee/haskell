# Exercises: Mood swing

```hs
data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show
```
> **deriving Show** allows the values of that type to be printed to the screen.

1. What is the type constructor, or name of this type?
> Type constructor: Mood

2. If the function requires a **Mood** value, what are the values
you could possibly use?
> Data constructor: Blah and Woot

3. We are trying to write a function <ins>changeMood</ins> to change
Chris’s mood instantaneously. It should act like `not` in that, given one value, it returns the other value of the same type.  
So far, we’ve written a type signature `changeMood :: Mood -> Woot`. What’s wrong with that?  
    > The type signature should be `changeMood :: Mood -> Mood`.

4. Now we want to write the function that changes his mood.  
Given an input mood, it gives us the other one.  
Fix any mistakes and complete the function:  
    ```hs
    changeMood :: Mood -> Mood
    changeMood Blah = Woot
    changeMood Woot = Blah
    ```

5. Enter all of the above—datatype (including the deriving Show bit), your corrected type signature, and the corrected function into a source file. Load it and run it in GHCi to make sure you got it right.
    ```hs
    data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving (Eq, Show)

    changeMood :: Mood -> Mood
    changeMood Blah = Woot
    changeMood _ = Blah
    ```
    > -- Notes: Error stating "...lacks accompanying binding" means that function is defined but not implemented.

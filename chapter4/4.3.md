# Exercises: Mood swing

```haskell
data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show
```
> deriving Show allows the values of that type to be
printed to the screen.

1. What is the type constructor, or name of this type?
> Type constructor: Mood

2. If the function requires a Mood value, what are the values
you could possibly use?
> Data constructor: Blah and Woot

3. We are trying to write a function changeMood to change
Chris’s mood instantaneously. It should act like not in
that, given one value, it returns the other value of the same
type. So far, we’ve written a type signature changeMood ::
Mood -> Woot. What’s wrong with that?
> The type signature should be changeMood :: Mood -> Mood.

4. Now we want to write the function that changes his mood.
Given an input mood, it gives us the other one. Fix any
mistakes and complete the function:
` changeMood :: Mood -> Mood
changeMood Blah = Woot
changeMood Woot = Blah `

5. Enter all of the above—datatype (including the deriving Show bit), your corrected type signature, and the corrected function into a source file. Load it and run it in GHCi to make sure you got it right.

# Chapter exercises
## Warm-up and review
For the following set of exercises, you are not expected to use folds. These are intended to review material from previous chapters. Feel free to use any syntax or structure from previous chapters that seems appropriate.  

1. Given the following sets of consonants and vowels:  
stops = "pbtdkg"  
vowels = "aeiou"  
a) Write a function that takes inputs from stops and
vowels and makes 3-tuples of all possible stop-vowel-stop combinations.  
These will not all correspond to real words in English, although the stop-vowel-stop pattern is common enough that many of them will.  

stopVowelstop 

b) Modify that function so that it only returns the combinations that begin with a p.  

c) Now set up lists of nouns and verbs (instead of stops
and vowels), and modify the function to make tuples
representing possible noun-verb-noun sentences.  

2. What does the following mystery function do? What is
its type? Try to get a good sense of what it does before
you test it in the REPL to verify it:
seekritFunc x =
div (sum (map length (words x)))
(length (words x))
> The function counts the number of letters in the word.
> seekritFunc :: String -> Int

3. We’d really like the answer to be more precise. Can you
rewrite that using fractional division?

## Rewriting functions using folds
In the previous chapter, you wrote these functions using direct
recursion over lists. The goal now is to rewrite them using folds.
Where possible, to gain a deeper understanding of folding, try
rewriting the fold version so that it is point-free.
Point-free versions of these functions written with a fold
should look like this:
myFunc = foldr f z
So, for example, with the and function:
-- direct recursion, not using &&
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd [] = True
myAnd (x:xs) =
if x == False
then False
else myAnd xs
-- direct recursion, using &&
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd [] = True
myAnd (x:xs) = x && myAnd xs
CHAPTER 10. DATA STRUCTURE ORIGAMI 576
-- fold, not point-free
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd = foldr
(\a b ->
if a == False
then False
else b) True
-- fold, both myAnd and the folding
-- function are point-free now
myAnd :: [Bool] -> Bool
myAnd = foldr (&&) True
The goal here is to converge on the final version where
possible. You don’t need to write all variations for each example, but the more variations you write, the deeper your
understanding of these functions will become.
1. myOr returns True if any Bool in the list is True:
myOr :: [Bool] -> Bool
myOr = undefined
2. myAny returns True if a -> Bool applied to any of the values
in the list returns True:
myAny :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Bool
myAny = undefined
CHAPTER 10. DATA STRUCTURE ORIGAMI 577
Example for validating myAny:
Prelude> myAny even [1, 3, 5]
False
Prelude> myAny odd [1, 3, 5]
True
3. Write two versions of myElem. One version should use
folding and the other should use any:
myElem :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> Bool
Prelude> myElem 1 [1..10]
True
Prelude> myElem 1 [2..10]
False
4. Implement myReverse. Don’t worry about trying to make
it lazy:
myReverse :: [a] -> [a]
myReverse = undefined
Prelude> myReverse "blah"
"halb"
Prelude> myReverse [1..5]
[5,4,3,2,1]
CHAPTER 10. DATA STRUCTURE ORIGAMI 578
5. Write myMap in terms of foldr. It should have the same
behavior as the built-in map:
myMap :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
myMap = undefined
6. Write myFilter in terms of foldr. It should have the same
behavior as the built-in filter:
myFilter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
myFilter = undefined
7. squish flattens a list of lists into a list:
squish :: [[a]] -> [a]
squish = undefined
8. squishMap maps a function over a list and concatenates the
result:
squishMap :: (a -> [b]) -> [a] -> [b]
squishMap = undefined
Prelude> squishMap (\x -> [1, x, 3]) [2]
[1,2,3]
Prelude> f x = "WO " ++ [x] ++ " OT "
Prelude> squishMap f "blah"
"WO b OT WO l OT WO a OT WO h OT "
CHAPTER 10. DATA STRUCTURE ORIGAMI 579
9. squishAgain flattens a list of lists into a list. This time, reuse the squishMap function:
squishAgain :: [[a]] -> [a]
squishAgain = undefined
10. myMaximumBy takes a comparison function and a list and
returns the greatest element of the list based on the last
value that the comparison returns GT for:
myMaximumBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering)
-> [a]
-> a
myMaximumBy = undefined
Prelude> myMaximumBy (\_ _ -> GT) [1..10]
1
Prelude> myMaximumBy (\_ _ -> LT) [1..10]
10
Prelude> myMaximumBy compare [1..10]
10
11. myMinimumBy takes a comparison function and a list and
returns the least element of the list based on the last value
that the comparison returns LT for:
CHAPTER 10. DATA STRUCTURE ORIGAMI 580
myMinimumBy :: (a -> a -> Ordering)
-> [a]
-> a
myMinimumBy = undefined
Prelude> myMinimumBy (\_ _ -> GT) [1..10]
10
Prelude> myMinimumBy (\_ _ -> LT) [1..10]
1
Prelude> myMinimumBy compare [1..10]
1

# Exercises: Understanding folds
1. foldr (*) 1 [1..5]

    Will return the same result as which of the following?  
    ~~a) flip (\*) 1 [1..5]~~  
    **b) foldl (flip (\*)) 1 [1..5]**  
    **c) foldl (\*) 1 [1..5]**  

2. Write out the evaluation steps for:
    ```hs
    foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3]

    flip[1..3] = [3,2,1]
    flip (*) 1 [1..3] = 3 * 2 * 1
    foldl (flip (*)) 1 [1..3] = 6
    
    ALTERNATIVELY:
    (1 (flip *) 1)
    ((1 (flip *) 1) (flip *) 2)
    (((1 (flip *) 1) (flip *) 2) (flip *) 3)

        (((1 * 1) (flip *) 2) (flip *) 3)
    ((1 (flip *) 2) (flip *) 3)
    ((2 * 1) (flip *) 3)
    (2 (flip *) 3)
    (3 * 2)
    6
    ```

3. One difference between foldr and foldl is:  
~~a) foldr, but not foldl, traverses the spine of a list from
right to left.~~  
~~b) foldr, but not foldl, always forces the rest of the fold.~~  
**c) foldr, but not foldl, associates to the right.**  
~~d) foldr, but not foldl, is recursive.~~  

4. Folds are catamorphisms, which means they are generally  
used to:  
**a) Reduce structure.**  
~~b) Expand structure.~~  
~~c) Render you catatonic.~~  
~~d) Generate infinite data structures.~~  

5. The following are simple folds very similar to what youâ€™ve
already seen, but each has <ins>at least one error</ins>.   
Please fix and test them in your REPL:  
a) foldr (++) "" ["woot", "WOOT", "woot"]  

b) foldr max [] '' "fear is the little death"  

c) foldr (&&) True [False, True]  

d) This one is more subtle than the previous. Can it
ever return a different answer?  
foldr (||) True [False, True]  
> To return a different answer, use underfined.

e) foldr ((++) . show) "" [1..5]

f ) foldr (flip const) 'a' [1..5]  

g) foldl const 0 "tacos"  

h) foldr (flip const) 0 "burritos"


i) foldl const 'z' [1..5]

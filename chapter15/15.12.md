Exercise: Maybe another Monoid
Write a Monoid instance for a Maybe type that doesn’t require a
Monoid for the contents. Reuse the Monoid law QuickCheck properties, and use them to validate the instance.
Don’t forget to write an Arbitrary instance for First'. We
won’t always stub that out explicitly for you. We suggest learning how to use the frequency function from QuickCheck for the
instance of First':
newtype First' a =
First' { getFirst' :: Optional a }
deriving (Eq, Show)
CHAPTER 15. MONOID, SEMIGROUP 921
instance Semigroup (First' a) where
(<>) = undefined
instance Monoid (First' a) where
mempty = undefined
firstMappend :: First' a
-> First' a
-> First' a
firstMappend = mappend
type FirstMappend =
First' String
-> First' String
-> First' String
-> Bool
type FstId =
First' String -> Bool
main :: IO ()
main = do
quickCheck (monoidAssoc :: FirstMappend)
quickCheck (monoidLeftIdentity :: FstId)
quickCheck (monoidRightIdentity :: FstId)
CHAPTER 15. MONOID, SEMIGROUP 922
Our expected output demonstrates a different Monoid for
Optional/Maybe, which is getting the first success and holding
onto it, where any exist. This could be seen, with a bit of
hand-waving, as being a disjunctive (“or”) Monoid instance:
Prelude> onlyOne = First' (Only 1)
Prelude> onlyTwo = First' (Only 2)
Prelude> nada = First' Nada
Prelude> onlyOne `mappend` nada
First' {getFirst' = Only 1}
Prelude> nada `mappend` nada
First' {getFirst' = Nada}
Prelude> nada `mappend` onlyTwo
First' {getFirst' = Only 2}
Prelude> onlyOne `mappend` onlyTwo
First' {getFirst' = Only 1}

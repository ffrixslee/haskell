# Exercises: Heavy lifting
Add **fmap**, **parentheses**, and **function composition** to each expression as needed for the expression to type check and produce the expected result. It may not always need to go in the same place, so donâ€™t become complacent:  

1. a = (+1) $ read "[1]" :: [Int]  
Expected result:  
Prelude> a  
[2]  
> Answer: `a = fmap (+1) $ read "[1]" :: [Int] `  

2. b = (++ "lol") (Just ["Hi,", "Hello"])  
Prelude> b  
Just ["Hi,lol","Hellolol"] 
> Answer: `b = (fmap . fmap) (++ "lol") (Just ["Hi,", "Hello"])` 


3. c = (*2) (\x -> x - 2)  
Prelude> c 1  
-2  
> Answer: `c = fmap (*2) (\x -> (x - 2))`

4. d =  
((return '1' ++) . show)  
(\x -> [x, 1..3])  
Prelude> d 0  
"1[0,1,2,3]"  
> Answer: 

```hs
d =
    fmap ((return '1' ++) . show)
    (\x -> [x, 1..3])
```

5. e :: IO Integer  
e = let ioi = readIO "1" :: IO Integer  
changed = read ("123"++) show ioi  
in (*3) changed  
Prelude> e  
3693 
> Answer:

```hs
e :: IO Integer
e = let ioi = readIO "1" :: IO Integer
        changed = fmap (fmap read (fmap ("123"++) show)) ioi
    in fmap (*3) changed
```

Exercise: Possibly
Write a Functor instance for a datatype identical to Maybe. We’ll
use our own datatype, because Maybe already has a Functor instance and we cannot make a duplicate one:
data Possibly a =
LolNope
| Yeppers a
deriving (Eq, Show)
instance Functor Possibly where
fmap = undefined
If it helps, you’re basically writing the following function:
applyIfJust :: (a -> b)
-> Maybe a
-> Maybe b

Short exercise
1. Write a Functor instance for a datatype identical to Either.
We’ll use our own datatype, because Either has a Functor
instance:
data Sum a b =
First a
| Second b
deriving (Eq, Show)
instance Functor (Sum a) where
fmap = undefined
CHAPTER 16. FUNCTOR 1004
Your hint for this one is that you’re actually writing the
following function:
applyIfSecond :: (a -> b)
-> (Sum e) a
-> (Sum e) b
2. Why is a Functor instance that applies a function only to
First, Either’s Left, impossible? We covered this earlier.

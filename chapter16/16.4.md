# Exercises: Be kind
Given a type signature, determine the kinds of each type variable:  
1. What’s the kind of a?  
f :: a -> a
> a has kind * .  
> Reason: The argument and result are both type a.

2. What are the kinds of b and T? (The T is capitalized on purpose!)  
f :: a -> b a -> T (b a)  
> b :: * -> *  
> Reason: b has argument type a.  
> T :: * -> * -> *
> Reason: T has argument types b and a.

3. What’s the kind of c?  
f :: c a b -> c b a  
> c :: * -> * -> *
> Reason: c has arguments type a and b.

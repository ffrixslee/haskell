16.10 Exercises: Instances of Func
Implement Functor instances for the following datatypes. Use
the QuickCheck properties we showed you to validate them:
1. newtype Identity a = Identity a
2. data Pair a = Pair a a
CHAPTER 16. FUNCTOR 995
3. data Two a b = Two a b
4. data Three a b c = Three a b c
5. data Three' a b = Three' a b b
6. data Four a b c d = Four a b c d
7. data Four' a b = Four' a a a b
8. Can you implement one for this type? Why? Why not?
data Trivial = Trivial
Doing these exercises is critical to understanding how Functor
worksâ€”do not skip past them!

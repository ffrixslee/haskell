1.11 Chapter exercises
We’re going to do the following exercises differently than what
you’ll see in the rest of the book. Unlike in subsequent chapters,
here we provide some answers and explanations for the
questions below.
Combinators Determine whether each of the following functions
are combinators or not:
1. 𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥𝑥
2. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑧𝑥
3. 𝜆𝑥𝑦𝑧.𝑥𝑦(𝑧𝑥)
4. 𝜆𝑥𝑦𝑧.𝑥𝑦(𝑧𝑥𝑦)
5. 𝜆𝑥𝑦.𝑥𝑦(𝑧𝑥𝑦)
Normal form or diverge? Determine whether each of the
following expressions can be reduced to a normal form or if
they diverge:
1. 𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥𝑥
2. (𝜆𝑧.𝑧𝑧)(𝜆𝑦.𝑦𝑦)
3. (𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥𝑥)𝑧

Beta reduce Evaluate (that is, beta reduce) each of the following
expressions to normal form. We strongly recommend
writing out the steps on paper with a pen or pencil:
1. (𝜆𝑎𝑏𝑐.𝑐𝑏𝑎)𝑧𝑧(𝜆𝑤𝑣.𝑤)
2. (𝜆𝑥.𝜆𝑦.𝑥𝑦𝑦)(𝜆𝑎.𝑎)𝑏
3. (𝜆𝑦.𝑦)(𝜆𝑥.𝑥𝑥)(𝜆𝑧.𝑧𝑞)
4. (𝜆𝑧.𝑧)(𝜆𝑧.𝑧𝑧)(𝜆𝑧.𝑧𝑦)
Hint: alpha equivalence.
5. (𝜆𝑥.𝜆𝑦.𝑥𝑦𝑦)(𝜆𝑦.𝑦)𝑦
6. (𝜆𝑎.𝑎𝑎)(𝜆𝑏.𝑏𝑎)𝑐
7. (𝜆𝑥𝑦𝑧.𝑥𝑧(𝑦𝑧))(𝜆𝑥.𝑧)(𝜆𝑥.𝑎)

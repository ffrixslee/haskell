# Exercise: Tuple experiment
Look at the types given for **quotRem** and **divMod**. What do you think those functions do? 
Test your hypotheses by playing with them in the REPL. We’ve
given you a sample to start with below:

Prelude> ones x = snd (divMod x 10)

> **divMod** returns a tuple containing result of integral division and modulo.

Prelude> f x = fst(quotRem x 5)
> **quotRem** returns a tuple containing quotient and remainder.


### Put on your thinking cap
Why didn’t we need to make the type of the function we wrote require both type classes? Why didn’t we have to do this:  
`f :: (Num a, Fractional a) => a -> a -> a`  
Consider what it means for something to be a subset of a larger set of objects.

> Since **Num** is a superclass of **Fractional**, we can't include both type classes in the function. Also, all instances of **Fractional** are **Num** but not all **Num** instances are **Fractional**. Hence, to include both classes would introduce a conflict in the type class of a.

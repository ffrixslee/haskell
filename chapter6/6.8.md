# Exercises: Will they work?
Next, take a look at the following code examples, and try to decide if they will work, what result they will return if they do, and why or why not (be sure, as always, to test them in your REPL once you have decided on your answers):


1. 
`max (length [1, 2, 3]) (length [8, 9, 10, 11, 12])`
> Will compile successfully  
> Output: 5


2. compare (3 * 4) (3 * 5) 
> Will compile successfully  
> Output: LT 

3. compare "Julie" True
> Won't compile successfully  
> Reason: Can't compare different types  

4. (5 + 3) > (3 + 6) 
> Will compile successfully  
> Output: False

20.6 Chapter exercises
Write Foldable instances for the following datatypes:
1. data Constant a b =
Constant b

2. data Two a b =
Two a b
3. data Three a b c =
Three a b c
4. data Three' a b =
Three' a b b
5. data Four' a b =
Four' a b b b
Thinking cap time. Write a filter function for Foldable types
using the foldMap function:
filterF :: ( Applicative f
, Foldable t
, Monoid (f a))
=> (a -> Bool) -> t a -> f a
filterF = undefined

Exercises: Library functions
Implement the functions in terms of foldMap or foldr from
Foldable, then try them out with multiple types that have
Foldable instances.
1. This and the next one are nicer with foldMap, but the foldr
function is fine, too:
sum :: (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
2. product :: (Foldable t, Num a) => t a -> a
3. elem :: (Foldable t, Eq a)
=> a -> t a -> Bool
4. minimum :: (Foldable t, Ord a)
=> t a -> Maybe a

5. maximum :: (Foldable t, Ord a)
=> t a -> Maybe a
6. null :: (Foldable t) => t a -> Bool
7. length :: (Foldable t) => t a -> Int
8. Some say this is all Foldable amounts to:
toList :: (Foldable t) => t a -> [a]
9. Hint: use foldMap:
-- | Combine the elements
-- of a structure using a monoid.
fold :: (Foldable t, Monoid m) => t m -> m
10. Define foldMap in terms of foldr:
foldMap :: (Foldable t, Monoid m)
=> (a -> m) -> t a -> m

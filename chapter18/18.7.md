# 18.7 Chapter exercises
Write Monad instances for the following types. Use the QuickCheck properties we showed you to validate your instances.  

1. Welcome to the Nope Monad, where nothing happens and
nobody cares:  
data Nope a =  
NopeDotJpg  
-- We're serious. Write it anyway.  

2. data BahEither b a =  
PLeft a  
| PRight b  

3. Write a Monad instance for Identity:  
newtype Identity a = Identity a  
deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)  
instance Functor Identity where  
fmap = undefined  
instance Applicative Identity where  
pure = undefined  
(<*>) = undefined  

instance Monad Identity where  
return = pure  
(>>=) = undefined  

4. This one should be easier than the Applicative instance was. Remember to use the Functor that Monad requires, then see where the chips fall:  
data List a =  
Nil  
| Cons a (List a)  

Write the following functions using the methods provided
by Monad and Functor. Using stuff like identity and composition is fine, but it has to type check with the types provided:  

1. j :: Monad m => m (m a) -> m a  
Expecting the following behavior:  
Prelude> j [[1, 2], [], [3]]  
[1,2,3]  
Prelude> j (Just (Just 1))  
Just 1  
Prelude> j (Just Nothing)  
Nothing  
Prelude> j Nothing  
Nothing  

2. l1 :: Monad m => (a -> b) -> m a -> m b  

3. l2 :: Monad m  
=> (a -> b -> c) -> m a -> m b -> m c  

4. a :: Monad m => m a -> m (a -> b) -> m b  

5. Youâ€™ll need recursion for this one:  
meh :: Monad m  
=> [a] -> (a -> m b) -> m [b]  

6. Hint: reuse meh:  
flipType :: (Monad m) => [m a] -> m [a]

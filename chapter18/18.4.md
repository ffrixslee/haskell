# Example of the list monad in use

```hs
twiceWhenEven :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
twiceWhenEven xs = do
x <- xs
if even x
then [x*x, x*x]
else [x*x]
```
> *Main> twiceWhenEven [1..5]  
> [1,4,4,9,16,16,25]

```hs
twiceWhenEven :: [Integer] -> [Integer]
twiceWhenEven xs = do
    x <- xs
    if even x
        then [x*x, x*x]
        else []
```
> *Main> twiceWhenEven [1..5]  
> [4,4,16,16]
> Will not return the values unless they are even.

# Short Exercise: Either Monad

```hs

Implement the Either Monad:  
data Sum a b =  
First a  
| Second b  
deriving (Eq, Show)  
 
instance Functor (Sum a) where  
  fmap _ (First a) = First a
  fmap f (Second b) = Second $ f b

instance Applicative (Sum a) where
  pure = Second
  (<*>) = ap
  (First a) <*> _ = First a
  _ <*> (First a) = First a
  (Second f) <*> (Second b) = Second $ f b

instance Monad (Sum a) where
  return = pure
  (First a) >>= _ = First a
  (Second b) >>= f = f b

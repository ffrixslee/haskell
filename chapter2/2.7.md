1. ~~ area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)~~ \
  **(correct solution):**   
  ```area x = 3.14 * (x * x)```

2. ~~ double x = b * 2 ~~  
  **(correct solution):**  
  > declare b variable

  `b = 2`

3. ~~ x = 7
    y = 10
  f = x + y ~~  
  **(correct solution):**
  > correct y and f variable indentations
  -- Don't use space, use Ctrl + ] !
  ```haskell
    x = 7
    y = 10
    f = x + y
  ```

# Exercises: Heal the sick
The following code samples are broken and wonâ€™t compile.  
The first two are as you might enter them into the REPL.  
The third is from a source file. Find the mistakes, and fix them so that the code will compile:

1. ~~area x = 3. 14 * (x * x)~~  

   **(correct solution):**   
    ```hs
    area x = 3.14 * (x * x)
    ```

2. ~~double x = b * 2~~  

   **(correct solution):**  
   > 'b' is not in scope.  
   > Fix: Declare b variable.  
   > ie, `b = 2`

3. 
    WRONG:  

        ```hs
        x = 7  
          y = 10  
        f = x + y
        ```
    
    **(correct solution):**  
    > correct y and f variable indentations  
    -- Don't use space, use Ctrl + ] !  
    ```hs
      x = 7
      y = 10
      f = x + y
    ```

# 2.11 Chapter Exercises

### Parenthisation
##### Given what we know about the precedence of , +, and ^, how can we parenthesize the following expressions more explicitly without changing their results? Put together answers you think are correct, then test them in the GHCi REPL.

###### For example, we want to make this more explicit:

~~ 2 + 2 * 3 - 3 ~~  
`2 + (2 * 3) - 3`

###### Attempt the above on the following expressions:
1. ~~ 2 + 2 * 3 - 1 ~~  
`2 + (2 * 3) - 1`

2. ~~ (^) 10 $ 1 + 1 ~~  
`(^10) $(1 + 1)`

3. ~~ 2 ^ 2 * 4 ^ 5 + 1 ~~
`( 2 ^ 2)(4 ^ 5) + 1`

### Equivalent expressions

1. `1 + 1 === 2`

2. `10 ^ 2 === 10 + 9 * 10 `
> '*' operator has higher precedence than '+'; '^' is right associative (infixr)

3. `400 - 37 === (-) 37 400`
> Never do (-10) 200 !

4. `100 div 3 === 100 / 3`
> Both 'div' and '/' are integral divisions

5. `2 * 5 + 18 != 2 * (5 + 18)
> Parenthisation has highest precedence

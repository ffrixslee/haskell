Exercises: Cardinality
While we haven’t explicitly described the rules for calculating
the cardinality of datatypes yet, you might already have an idea
of how to do it for simple datatypes with nullary constructors.
Try not to overthink these exercises—follow your intuition
based on what you know:
1. data PugType = PugData
2. For this one, recall that Bool is also defined with the |
symbol:
data Airline =
PapuAir
| CatapultsR'Us
| TakeYourChancesUnited
3. Given what we know about Int8, what’s the cardinality of
Int16?
4. Use the REPL and maxBound and minBound to examine Int
and Integer. What can you say about the cardinality of
those types?
5. Extra credit (impress your friends!): what’s the connection
between the 8 in Int8 and that type’s cardinality of 256?
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 612
Simple datatypes with nullary data constructors
We’ll start our exploration of cardinality by looking at datatypes
with nullary data constructors:
data Example = MakeExample deriving Show
Example is our type constructor, and MakeExample is our only
data constructor. Since MakeExample takes no type arguments, it
is a nullary constructor. We know that nullary data constructors
are constants and represent only themselves as values. It is a
single value whose only content is its name, not any other data.
We can think of nullary constructors as representing one value,
when we reason about the cardinality of the types they inhabit.
All you can say about MakeExample is that the constructor is
the value MakeExample and that it inhabits the type Example.
There, the only inhabitant is MakeExample. Given that MakeExample
is a single nullary value, the cardinality of the type Example is 1.
This is useful, because it tells us that any time we see Example in
the type signature of a function, we only have to reason about
one possible value.
Exercises: For example
1. You can query the type of a value in GHCi with the :type
command, also abbreviated :t.
Example:
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 613
Prelude> :t False
False :: Bool
What is the type of the data constructor MakeExample? What
happens when you request the type of Example?
2. What if you try :info on Example in GHCi? Can you determine what type class instances are defined for the Example
type using :info in GHCi?
3. Try making a new datatype like Example but with a single
type argument added to MakeExample, such as Int. What
has changed when you query MakeExample with :type in
GHCi?

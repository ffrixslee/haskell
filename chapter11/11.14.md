Exercises: The Quad
Determine how many unique inhabitants each type has.
Suggestion: do the arithmetic, unless you want to verify.
Writing them out gets tedious quickly:
1. data Quad =
One
| Two
| Three
| Four
deriving (Eq, Show)
-- How many different forms can this take?
eQuad :: Either Quad Quad
eQuad = ???
2. prodQuad :: (Quad, Quad)
3. funcQuad :: Quad -> Quad
4. prodTBool :: (Bool, Bool, Bool)
5. gTwo :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
6. Hint: five digit number
fTwo :: Bool -> Quad -> Quad

# Exercises: The Quad
Determine how many unique inhabitants each type has.
Suggestion: do the arithmetic, unless you want to verify.
Writing them out gets tedious quickly:  
1. data Quad =  
One  
| Two  
| Three  
| Four  
deriving (Eq, Show)  
-- How many different forms can this take?  
eQuad :: Either Quad Quad  
eQuad = ???  
> Either is a sum type so 4 + 4 = 8 possible values.  

2. prodQuad :: (Quad, Quad)  
> Tuples are product types so there are 4 * 4 = 16 possible values.  

3. funcQuad :: Quad -> Quad  
> Functions are exponential types so there are 4 ^ 4 = 256 possible function values with this signature.  

4. prodTBool :: (Bool, Bool, Bool)  
> Another tuple with 3 elements so 4 * 4 * 4 = 64 values.  

5. gTwo :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool  
> Function type again so 2 ^ 2 ^ 2 = 16 possible functions.  

6. Hint: five digit number  
fTwo :: Bool -> Quad -> Quad 
> We saw that the cardinality of a -> b -> c is c ^ (b * a) so we have Bool -> Quad -> Quad has cardinality 4 ^ 8 = 65536.

Exercises: Pity the Bool
1. Given a datatype:
data BigSmall =
Big Bool
| Small Bool
deriving (Eq, Show)
What is its cardinality? Hint: We already know Bool’s
cardinality. Show your work, as demonstrated earlier.
2. Given a datatype:
-- bring Int8 in scope
import Data.Int
data NumberOrBool =
Numba Int8
| BoolyBool Bool
deriving (Eq, Show)
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 624
myNumba = Numba (-128)
What is the cardinality of NumberOrBool? What happens if
you try to create a Numba with a numeric literal larger than
127? And with a numeric literal smaller than -128?
If you choose (-128) for a value precisely, you’ll notice
you get a spurious warning:
Prelude> n = Numba (-129)
Literal -129 is out of the
Int8 range -128..127
Now, since -128 is a perfectly valid Int8 value, you could
choose to ignore this. What happens is that (-128) desugars into (negate 128). The compiler sees that you expect
the type Int8, but Int8’s max boundary is 127. So even
though you’re negating 128, it hasn’t done that step yet
and immediately whines about 128 being larger than 127.
One way to avoid that warning is the following:
Prelude> n = (-128)
Prelude> x = Numba n
Or you can use the NegativeLiterals extension as it recommends:
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 625
Prelude> :set -XNegativeLiterals
Prelude> n = Numba (-128)
Note that the negative literals extension doesn’t prevent
the warning if you use negate directly.

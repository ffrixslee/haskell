Multiple choice
1. Given the following datatype:  
data Weekday =  
  Monday  
| Tuesday  
| Wednesday  
| Thursday  
| Friday  

Which of the following is true?  
**a) Weekday is a type with five data constructors.**  
~~b) Weekday is a tree with five branches.~~  
~~c) Weekday is a product type.~~  
~~d) Weekday takes five arguments.~~  

2. With the same datatype definition in mind, what is the type of the following function, f?  
f Friday = "Miller Time"  
~~a) f :: [Char]~~  
~~b) f :: String -> String~~  
**c) f :: Weekday -> String**

3. Types defined with the data keyword:  
~~a) Must have at least one argument.~~  
~~b) Must begin with a capital letter.~~  
~~c) Must be polymorphic.~~  
**d) Cannot be imported from modules.**  

4. The function g xs = xs !! (length xs - 1):  
~~a) Is recursive and may not terminate.~~  
~~b) Returns the head of xs.~~  
**c) Returns the final element of xs.**  
~~d) Has the same type as xs.~~  
> (length xs - 1) refers to the last element.  

## Ciphers
In Chapter 9, on lists, you wrote a Caesar cipher. Now, we
want to expand on that idea by writing a Vigenère cipher. A Vigenère cipher is another substitution cipher, based on a Caesar
cipher, but it uses a series of Caesar ciphers for polyalphabetic
substitution. The substitution for each letter in the plain text
is determined by a fixed keyword.
So, for example, if you want to encode the message “meet
at dawn,” the first step is to pick a keyword that will determine
which Caesar cipher to use. We’ll use the keyword “ALLY” here.
You repeat the keyword for as many characters as there are in
your original message:

MEET AT DAWN
ALLY AL LYAL
The number of rightward shifts to make to encode each
character is set by the character of the keyword that lines up
with it. The “A” means a shift of 0, so the initial M will remain
M. But the “L” for our second character sets a rightward shift
of 11, so “E” becomes “P.” And so on, therefore “meet at dawn”
encoded with the keyword “ALLY” becomes “MPPR AE OYWY.”
Like the Caesar cipher, you can find all kinds of resources to
help you understand this cipher, too, and also many examples
written in Haskell. Consider using a combination of chr, ord,
and mod again, possibly very similar to what you used for writing
the original Caesar cipher.  

## As-patterns
As-patterns in Haskell are a nifty way to be able to pattern match on part of something and still refer to the entire original value.  
Some examples:  
f :: Show a => (a, b) -> IO (a, b)  
f t@(a, _) = do  
print a  
return t  

Here, we pattern match on a tuple so we can get at the first
value for printing, but use the @ symbol to introduce a binding named t in order to refer to the whole tuple rather than just a part:  

Prelude> f (1, 2)  
1  
(1,2)  

We can use as-patterns with pattern matching on arbitrary
data constructors, which includes lists:  
doubleUp :: [a] -> [a]  
doubleUp [] = []  
doubleUp xs@(x:_) = x : xs  
Prelude> doubleUp []  
[]  
Prelude> doubleUp [1]  
[1,1]  
Prelude> doubleUp [1, 2]  
[1,1,2]  
Prelude> doubleUp [1, 2, 3]  
[1,1,2,3]  

Use as-patterns to implement the following functions:  

1. This should return True if (and only if ) all the values in
the first list appear in the second list, though they need
not be contiguous:  
isSubseqOf :: (Eq a)  
=> [a]  
-> [a]  
-> Bool  
The following are examples of how this function should
work:  
Prelude> isSubseqOf "blah" "blahwoot"  
True  
Prelude> isSubseqOf "blah" "wootblah"  
True  
Prelude> isSubseqOf "blah" "wboloath"  
True  
Prelude> isSubseqOf "blah" "wootbla"  
False  
Prelude> isSubseqOf "blah" "halbwoot"  
False  
Prelude> isSubseqOf "blah" "blawhoot"  
True  
Remember that the sub-sequence has to be in the original
order!  

2. Split a sentence into words, then tuple each one with its
capitalized form:
capitalizeWords :: String
-> [(String, String)]
Prelude> capitalizeWords "hello world"
[("hello", "Hello"), ("world", "World")]
Language exercises
1. Write a function that capitalizes a word:
capitalizeWord :: String -> String
capitalizeWord = undefined
Example output:
Prelude> capitalizeWord "Chortle"
"Chortle"
Prelude> capitalizeWord "chortle"
"Chortle"
2. Write a function that capitalizes sentences in a paragraph.
Recognize when a new sentence has begun by checking
for periods. Reuse the capitalizeWord function:
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 685
capitalizeParagraph :: String -> String
capitalizeParagraph = undefined
Example result you should get from your function:
Prelude> s = "blah. woot ha."
Prelude> capitalizeParagraph s
"Blah. Woot ha."
Phone exercise
This exercise by Twitter user @geophf6 was originally for
1HaskellADay.7 Thank you for letting us use this exercise!
Remember old-fashioned phone inputs for writing text,
where you had to press a button multiple times to get different
letters to come up? You may still have to do this when you try
to search for a movie to watch using your television remote
control. You’re going to write code to translate sequences of
button presses into strings and vice versa.
So! Here is the layout of the phone:
6https://twitter.com/geophf
7https://twitter.com/1haskelladay
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 686
-----------------------------------------
| 1 | 2 ABC | 3 DEF |
-----------------------------------------
| 4 GHI | 5 JKL | 6 MNO |
-----------------------------------------
| 7 PQRS | 8 TUV | 9 WXYZ |
-----------------------------------------
| * ^ | 0 + _ | # ., |
-----------------------------------------
The star (*) capitalizes the current letter, and 0 is your space
bar. To represent the digit itself, you press that digit once more
than the letters it represents. If you press a button one more
than is required to type the digit, it wraps around to the first
letter. For example:
2 -> 'A'
22 -> 'B'
222 -> 'C'
2222 -> '2'
22222 -> 'A'
So on and so forth. We’re going to kick this around.
1. Create a data structure that captures the phone layout
above. The data structure should be able to express
enough of how the layout works that you can use it to
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 687
dictate the behavior of the functions in the following
exercises:
-- fill in the rest
data DaPhone = DaPhone
2. Convert the following conversations into the key presses
required to express them. We’re going to suggest types
and functions to complete, in order to accomplish the
goal, but they’re not obligatory. If you want to do it
differently, go right ahead:
convo :: [String]
convo =
["Wanna play 20 questions",
"Ya",
"U 1st haha",
"Lol OK. Have u ever tasted alcohol",
"Lol ya",
"Wow ur cool haha. Ur turn",
"OK. Do u think I am pretty Lol",
"Lol ya",
"Just making sure rofl ur turn"]
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 688
-- validButtons = "1234567890*#"
type Digit = Char
-- Valid presses: 1 and up
type Presses = Int
reverseTaps :: DaPhone
-> Char
-> [(Digit, Presses)]
reverseTaps = undefined
-- assuming the default phone definition
-- 'a' -> [('2', 1)]
-- 'A' -> [('*', 1), ('2', 1)]
cellPhonesDead :: DaPhone
-> String
-> [(Digit, Presses)]
cellPhonesDead = undefined
3. How many times do digits need to be pressed for each
message?
fingerTaps :: [(Digit, Presses)] -> Presses
fingerTaps = undefined
4. What is the most popular letter for each message? What
was its cost? You’ll want to combine reverseTaps and fingerTaps
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 689
to figure out what it costs in taps. reverseTaps is a list, because you need to press a different button in order to get
capitals.
mostPopularLetter :: String -> Char
mostPopularLetter = undefined
5. What is the most popular letter overall? What is the
overall most popular word?
coolestLtr :: [String] -> Char
coolestLtr = undefined
coolestWord :: [String] -> String
coolestWord = undefined
Hutton’s Razor
Hutton’s Razor8
is a simple expression language that expresses
integer literals and the addition of values. The “trick” to it is that
it’s recursive, and the two expressions you’re summing together
could be literals or themselves further addition operations.
This sort of datatype is stereotypical of expression languages
used to motivate ideas in research papers and functional pearls.
Evaluating or folding a datatype is also in some sense what
you’re doing most of the time while programming anyway.

CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 690
1. Your first task is to write the “eval” function that reduces
an expression to a final sum:
data Expr
= Lit Integer
| Add Expr Expr
eval :: Expr -> Integer
eval = error "do it to it"
Example of expected output:
Prelude> eval (Add (Lit 1) (Lit 9001))
9002
2. Write a printer for the expressions:
printExpr :: Expr -> String
printExpr = undefined
Expected output:
Prelude> printExpr (Add (Lit 1) (Lit 9001))
"1 + 9001"
Prelude> a1 = Add (Lit 9001) (Lit 1)
Prelude> a2 = Add a1 (Lit 20001)
Prelude> a3 = Add (Lit 1) a2
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 691
Prelude> printExpr a3
"1 + 9001 + 1 + 20001"

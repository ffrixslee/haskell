# Exercise: Programmers
Write a function that generates all possible values of Programmer.  
Use the provided lists of inhabitants of OperatingSystem and
ProgLang:  

allOperatingSystems :: [OperatingSystem]  
allOperatingSystems =  
[ GnuPlusLinux  
, OpenBSDPlusNevermindJustBSDStill  
, Mac  
, Windows  
]  

allLanguages :: [ProgLang]  
allLanguages =  
[Haskell, Agda, Idris, PureScript]

allProgrammers :: [Programmer]  
allProgrammers = undefined  

Programmer is a product of two types. You can determine the
number of inhabitants of Programmer by calculating:  

- length allOperatingSystems * length allLanguages  

This is the essence of how product types and the number
of inhabitants relate.  

There are several ways you could write a function to do
this, and some may produce a list that has duplicate values
in it. If your resulting list has duplicate values in it, you can use nub from Data.List to remove duplicate values over your allProgrammers value. Either way, if your result (minus any duplicate values) equals the number returned by multiplying those lengths together, youâ€™ve probably got it figured out.  

Try to be clever and make it work without manually typing out the values.

```hs
allProgrammers :: [Programmer]
allProgrammers = [Programmer { os = o, lang = l }
                 | o <- allOperatingSystems, l <- allLanguages]
```

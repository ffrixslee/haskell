# Exercises: Vehicles
For these exercises, we’ll use the datatypes defined in the above section. It would be good if you’ve typed them all into a source file already, but if you haven’t, please do so now. You can then define some sample data on your own, or use these to get you started:  

data Vehicle = Car Manufacturer Price | Plane Airline 
deriving (Eq, Show)

myCar = Car Mini (Price 14000)  
urCar = Car Mazda (Price 20000)  
clownCar = Car Tata (Price 7000)  
doge = Plane PapuAir  

1. What is the type of myCar?  
> myCar :: Vehicle  

2. Given the following, define the functions:  
isCar :: Vehicle -> Bool  
isCar = undefined

```hs
isCar :: Vehicle -> Bool
isCar (Car _ _) = True
isCar _         = False
```

isPlane :: Vehicle -> Bool  
isPlane = undefined  

```hs
isPlane :: Vehicle -> Bool
isPlane (Plane _) = True
isPlane _         = False
```

areCars :: [Vehicle] -> [Bool]  
areCars = undefined  

```hs
areCars :: [Vehicle] -> [Bool]
areCars = map isCar
```

3. Now, we’re going to write a function to tell us the manufacturer of a piece of data:  
getManu :: Vehicle -> Manufacturer  
getManu = undefined  

```hs
getManu :: Vehicle -> Manufacturer
getManu (Car x _) = x
getManu _         = error "getManu requires a Car value"
```

4. Given that we’re returning the Manufacturer, what will happen if you use this on Plane data?  
> Raises Runtime error.  

5. All right. Let’s say you decide to add the size of the plane as an argument to the Plane constructor. Add that to your datatypes in the appropriate places, and change your data and functions appropriately.

```hs
data Size = Size Integer deriving (Eq, Show)
...
doge = Plane PapuAir (Size 325)
...
isPlane :: Vehicle -> Bool
isPlane (Plane _ _) = True
isPlane _           = False
```

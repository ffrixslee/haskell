Exercises: Vehicles
For these exercises, we’ll use the datatypes defined in the above
section. It would be good if you’ve typed them all into a source
file already, but if you haven’t, please do so now. You can then
define some sample data on your own, or use these to get you
started:
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 604
myCar = Car Mini (Price 14000)
urCar = Car Mazda (Price 20000)
clownCar = Car Tata (Price 7000)
doge = Plane PapuAir
1. What is the type of myCar?
2. Given the following, define the functions:
isCar :: Vehicle -> Bool
isCar = undefined
isPlane :: Vehicle -> Bool
isPlane = undefined
areCars :: [Vehicle] -> [Bool]
areCars = undefined
3. Now, we’re going to write a function to tell us the manufacturer of a piece of data:
getManu :: Vehicle -> Manufacturer
getManu = undefined
4. Given that we’re returning the Manufacturer, what will happen if you use this on Plane data?
CHAPTER 11. RULE THE TYPES, RULE THE WORLD 605
5. All right. Let’s say you decide to add the size of the plane
as an argument to the Plane constructor. Add that to your
datatypes in the appropriate places, and change your data
and functions appropriately.
